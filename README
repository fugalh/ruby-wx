= Ruby WX
WX is shorthand for weather in aviation circles. Ruby WX is a library for
dealing with aviation weather codes, namely METAR and (soon) TAF. Although
intended for aviation, they are a useful way of getting a recent weather
synopsis or forecast even for nonaviators.

This release has been coded to the specification in 
[Federal Meteorological Handbook No. 1 Chapter 12](http://www.nws.noaa.gov/oso/oso1/oso12/fmh1/fmh1ch12.htm#ch12link).

== Synopsis
require 'wx/metar'
m = METAR.parse('KLRU 260533Z AUTO 12013G19KT 10SM SCT026 SCT032 OVC039 07/02 A3020 RMK AO2')

m.auto?                 #=> true
m.wind.direction        #=> '120 deg'.unit
m.wind.speed            #=> '13 knots'.unit
m.wind.gust             #=> '19 knots'.unit
m.visibility            #=> '10 miles'.unit
m.sky.first.cover       #=> 'SCT' [1]
m.sky.first.height      #=> '2600 feet'.unit
m.sky[1].cover          #=> 'SCT'
m.sky[1].height         #=> '3200 feet'.unit
